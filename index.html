        Every year the president gives an address to the people, but what dictates the speech he gives? Does it have to stay in line with other SOTU speeches previously given. Is it influenced by the economy, recent events, political party? We break it down.

        <div class="title">Filler Words</div>
        As expected, I could only focus on the flaws: the rushed speech, the odd phrases, and, most especially, all the filler words. In fact, I found 180 filler words in my 30 minute talk.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">My Talk</div>
        Here are all 5,040 words of my talk.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">My Stumbles</div>
        And here are all the fillers I used in those 30 minutes.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Um's, Ah's &amp; Uh's</div>
        I almost exclusively used these three fillers. Um's and Ah's made up over 80%, with Uh's trailing behind.
